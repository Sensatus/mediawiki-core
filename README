The timetotrade repo was based on release 1.21 of the MediaWiki code.

To add an extension create a subtree, for example the following will create
a CategoryTree folder in the extensions folder:

git subtree add --prefix=extensions/CategoryTree https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-CategoryTree.git master

To update a subtree extension:

git subtree pull --prefix=extensions/CategoryTree https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-CategoryTree.git master

== MediaWiki ==

MediaWiki is a free and open-source wiki software package written in PHP. It
serves as the platform for Wikipedia and the other projects of the Wikimedia
Foundation, which deliver content in over 280 languages to more than half a
billion people each month. MediaWiki's reliability and robust feature set have
earned it a large and vibrant community of third-party users and developers.

MediaWiki is:

* feature-rich and extensible, both on-wiki and with hundreds of extensions;
* scalable and suitable for both small and large sites;
* simple to install, working on most hardware/software combinations; and
* available in your language.
